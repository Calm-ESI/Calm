# Calm PLatform:

- ###  calM is a CPU architecture learning machine designed for educational purposes, offering a simplified representation of fundamental CPU concepts to aid in understanding computer architecture.

- ###  calM machine offers a simple ISA and assembly language. Our platform includes an emulator and simulator for program execution and visualization, along with courses and learning materials for computer architecture.

- ### This project was created by a team of six 2nd-year students from ESI-Alger as part of a class project. The objective was to develop a pedagogical machine with a simulation of code execution to teach computer architecture. We were a team of four teams assigned to develop different projects for the class. We successfully designed and developed the learning platform, which includes the calm machine, with its emulator and simulator to meet the pedagogical goals.
